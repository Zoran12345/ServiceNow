# ServiceNow

I’m a recent graduate, currently building my professional journey with Accenture as my first full-time role, where I am gaining valuable experience and exposure in a dynamic environment. Prior to joining Accenture, I interned at Playgroundzero.io, where I worked as a UI/UX designer and tester. During my internship, I focused on creating user-centric designs and improving interface usability, while also conducting testing to ensure optimal performance and functionality. This hands-on experience allowed me to develop a solid foundation in design principles and testing methodologies, skills I’m excited to deepen and apply in my current role.
